## Installation

Requires **python3.9** or higher

Install simulator packages only

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Simulator

```bash
bash clock_game.sh False seed_number
```

Simulator Scheme : Player 1 always plays in black, player 2 always plays in blue, and player 3 always plays in red.
All entries in the clock will be masked if a player has not chosen their constraints yet.

If you decide to end the simulator prematurely, press Control+D to terminate the bash script and then run your next command.

### Running without Simulator

```bash
bash clock_game.sh True seed_number
```

You can change the random seed, number of constraints per player and timeout by changing the values inside constants.py.





The final result and log files should look as shown in the file "Result_example.png".
